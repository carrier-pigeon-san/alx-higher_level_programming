Introductory project to pythone programmming

## Why Python programming is awesome?
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting
and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

## Python Pioneer
Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, conceived the Python Programming Language in the late 80s in
at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) - Netherlands - as a successor to ABC
programmin language.

Python's name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Guido
enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references are often used
in Python code and culture; for example, terms *spam and eggs* instead of *foo
and bar* as metasyntstic variables

## The Zen of Python
The Zen of Python is a set of `19` guiding principles for writing computer programs
that ifluenced Python's design.

>### Zen
>> The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
>>
>> Beautiful is better than ugly.
>> Explicit is better than implicit.
>> Simple is better than complex.
>> Complex is better than complicated.
>> Flat is better than nested.
>> Sparse is better than dense.
>> Readability counts.
>> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
>> Although practicality beats purity.
>> Errors should never pass silently.
>> Unless explicitly silenced.
>> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
>> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
>> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
>> Now is better than never.
>> Although never is often better than *right* now.
>> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
>> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
>> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
